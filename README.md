# TABLEU
getting to know TABLEU
Task (step by step):

1. In the Tableau workbook, created calculated fields for the following metrics:
Total Revenue
Paid Users count
Average Revenue Per Paid Users

2. After that, I created the following charts (or tables):
A chart that allows you to visually compare the total Revenue for each location + product combination.
A chart that allows you to compare the total Revenue for each location.
A chart that shows the total Revenue by month broken down by product. The breakdown should be color-coded.
Chart showing ARPPU and Paid Users Count by month.
Built a box plot to compare transaction amounts.
Created a chart showing how each location's share of Revenue changes over time.
3. Created a dashboard and added 6 sheets to it from this and the previous task. 

4. Added filters to the dashboard with location, product, and date. The filters apply to all charts on the dashboard.
